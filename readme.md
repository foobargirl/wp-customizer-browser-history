## Description ##

*This is a feature plugin intended to implement [#34923](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28536): Add browser history and deep linking for navigation in Customizer preview*

This plugin keeps the Customizer URL in the browser updated with current previewed URL as the `url` query param and current expanded panel/section/control as `autofocus` params. This allows for bookmarking and also the ability to reload and return go the same view (which is great for developers). This works best with the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots">Customize Snapshots</a> plugin, which allows allows you to save your Customizer state in a shapshot/changeset with an associated UUID that also gets added to the browser URL in the Customizer.
